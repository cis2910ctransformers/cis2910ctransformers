    <p>There are many developments that heavily uses Machine Learning. A great example of this is Voice Assistantance.
      One
      company that I believe stands out the most is Google. Google Voice Assistance is so brilliant and understands its
      mistakes that it hardly fails. Google has put in many investments and effort to prefect it's own software AI that
      I
      believe it beats its competitors like Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, and Windows Cortana but none the less all are
      heavily being used by Machine-Learning and learning under these developments.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Another great development in machine-learning that has been floating around a lot more as well is facial
      recognition. A lot of this comes from cell phones detecting real-time facial recognition as additional security
      and
      added level of biometrics. Some examples of today world using facial recognition are
      <ol>
        <li>Major League Baseball will soon start allow fans to validate tickets by scanning their face.</li>
        <li>Singapore's new mega-mall will track shoppers and recommend deals to them, on the fly. </li>
        <li>The organizing committee behind the 2020 Olympics in Tokoyo has said it will include facial recognition
          systems in order to improve security. </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    </h1>
    <p>One of the most greastest accomplishments that was made by the evolution of Machine-Learning technology was when
      AI
      defeated a professional E-Sport team. A project naming themselves OpenAI Five created a video game bot to play
      against human players in a competitive five-on-five video game called Dota 2. Dota 2 is a multiplayer online
      battle
      arena (MOBA), which could take months and even years to master and prefect in the understanding of the game. These
      AI bots were able to use machine-learning to adapt and learn as they play the game to defeat the human players in
      a
      24 minute game.

    </p>

    <p>Another great accomplishments to Machine-Learning is the use and understanding of AI. There is a company right
      now
      that are creating robots and they are quickly learning to adapt and develop different understading to situations
      and
      to their environments. This company is called Boston Dynamics. They have made many videos of their achievements
      that
      they have completed and are still working on. One of the things that Boston Dynamics have created was a robot
      moving
      at a top speeds of 28.3 MPH and impersonating the movement of a cheetah, this robot was able to run at this speeds
      while jumping over obstacles. Another robot that they have created was a robot that was able to pick up an object,
      be hit around and shoved aggressibely and still be able to maintain its balance while holding the object. I
      believe
      this is the way of the future and will help us to achieve many things that us human are not capable of doing.
